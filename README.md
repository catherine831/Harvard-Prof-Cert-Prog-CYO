In this report, a video game sales in North America predictive model will be built based on selected training sets of the Video Game Sales with Ratings. Video game sales from Vgchartz and corresponding ratings from Metacritic dataset are extracted from Kaggle which is an online community of data scientists and machine learners, owned by Google LLC. Four algorithms will be applied: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Elastic Net and Random Forest. The result will be compared and analysed by the performance of Residual Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
